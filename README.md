This repository contains the implementation for the `VR Development` pathway provided by [Unity](https://unity.com/). We'll learn the principles of developing a virtual reality project and include basic interactions like **movement** and object **grabbing**, Discover how to incorporate more complicated interactions in VR, such as `audio`, `haptics`, and `user interfaces`(UI), to make the experience more immersive. Investigate VR ergonomics and optimization to make programs as accessible and comfortable as feasible, and lastly Learn how to build scripts for **complex interactions** in virtual reality apps and construct your own one-of-a-kind VR project.

 
## VR Basics
Learn the basics of setting up a VR project and implementing simple interactivity like locomotion and grabbing objects.
